## Targeting the Right Customers: Predicting Bank Term Deposit Signups
In the highly competitive banking industry, acquiring new customers and promoting long-term financial products such as term deposits requires precise targeting and effective marketing strategies. Traditional marketing campaigns often lead to high operational costs with low conversion rates due to indiscriminate outreach. This project aims to address this challenge by applying machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, using historical marketing data collected by a bank.

By analyzing a variety of customer attributes—including demographic factors (age, job, marital status), financial indicators (housing loan, credit default), and previous campaign performance—this project builds a binary classification model to distinguish between likely and unlikely subscribers. The goal is to enable the bank to prioritize high-potential leads, reduce operationatal costs , increase conversion rates and improve overall campaign efficiency. In doing so, we bridge the gap between business goals and data-driven decision making.
